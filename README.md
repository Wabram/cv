- Project manager and executive (wet lab, in silico analyses); 
- Budget management;
- Performed **wet laboratory** (experiments with Agilent's gene expression and miRNA microarrays as Watson-Crick base paring of indirect **transcriptome** form cDNA (mRNA, lncRNA, lincRNA, sno/snRNA, ncRNA, miscRNA, miRNA, pos/neg/spike-in QC)(none of Hoogsteen base paring procedures), MTT drug testing (proteasome inhibitor, terpen),  total RNA/DNA isolation, purification, quality, quantity (Bioanalyzer, NanoDrop), gene validation (qPCR, primer design, analysis)) 
- and **in silico** using open-source programming/biostatistical **R/RStudio** with packages from cran, bioconductor, github repos (pre-processing, numerical validation awarness, glmm, Bayesian, multivariate, pathway enrichment analysis). On time delivering wet lab experiments, performing and precaution of misleading computational analysis.
