# About Me

## [Molecular Oncologist & Computational Scientist (cv)](https://Wabram.github.io/cv)
using proteasomes inhibitor, nutritranscriptomics

- Budget management;
- Project manager and executive (wet lab, in silico analyses); 
- Performed **`wet laboratory`** (experiments with Agilent's gene expression and miRNA microarrays as Watson-Crick base paring of indirect **transcriptome** form cDNA (mRNA, lncRNA, lincRNA, sno/snRNA, ncRNA, miscRNA, miRNA)(none of Hoogsteen base paring procedures), quality controls (pos/neg/spike-in), MTT drug testing (proteasome inhibitor, terpen),  total RNA/DNA isolation, purification, quality, quantity (Bioanalyzer, NanoDrop), gene validation (qPCR, primer design, analysis)) 
- and **`in silico`** analyses using open-source programming/biostatistical **R/RStudio** with packages from cran, bioconductor, github repos (pre-processing, numerical validation awareness, glm, Bayesian, multivariate, pathway enrichment analysis). On time delivering wet lab experiments, performing and precaution of misleading computational analysis.

I am currently `looking for a job`. If you are hiring **a Computational Oncologist** or **a Molecular Biologist**  or **an UI/ Graphic Designer**, let me know!
